# CLIP is awesome 

## ELI5 (Explain like I'm 5 years old)
CLIP is able to connect the meaning of a text with the meaning of an image. It converts the image into a long list of numbers. It also converts the text into a long list of numbers. Now that we only have numbers (hundreds of them!), we can compare both lists and check if the meaning of the text is similar to the meaning of the image. We can ask CLIP if a dog is in the image so we don't have to check every image manually. For building CLIP, the system was teached with millions of images with its description, so it could learn from the examples.

## CLIP in a nutshell

CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training) is a neural network which efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision, through the use of Contrastive Learning. It can be used as a classification tool where we can compare the embeddings of an image
